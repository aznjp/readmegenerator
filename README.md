## Description
For any project or repository there needs to be a summary on what the code you have developed actually does. From what the purpose of the application is to how it is utilized; the project needs a good description and a set format to allow for easy reading. This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md template and fills in those sections with your inputs.  Certain questions will require specific file formats, but they follow practical naming conventions. If necessary, there is a video enlisted in the assets/images folder to go through the steps of the application.

## Installation
Prior to starting this application, you must install the inquirer module and its JSON files

    npm install inquirer 

## Usage
When using the node.js runtime environment, the inquirer module will prompt questions on what you want to put into your project. The application will then write those answers into the template that is found in the generateMarkdown function to fill out and the fs module will fill that file with the information to give you a professional README.md file

## Test
Run the javascript file in node and check for lines in which the function is not currently running. Once this is finished run your code once again to verify if there are any other issues recurring.
