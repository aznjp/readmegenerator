    ##Description
    For any project or repository there needs to be a summary on what the code you have developed actually does. From what the purpose of the application is to how it is utilized; the project needs a good description and a set format to allow for easy reading. This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md template and fills in those sections with your inputs.  

    ##Installation
    ['inquirer']

    ##Usage
    When using the node.js runtime environment, the inquirer module will prompt questions on what you want to put into your project. The application will then write those answers into the template that is found in the generateMarkdown function to fill out and the fs module will fill that file with the information to give you a professional README.md file
